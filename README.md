# Console Wars - basic 2019 - dungeon crawl

The 3rd attempt in starting this project. A collect anything card battle.

In this is a solo play. With simpler system of fight monsters on each floor progressing to hard floors.

## Console Wars:
 captuer (almost) any monster or characters from across the universe.
 use various items to caputer
 their evolutions vary
 added mechanics for zombified and 2d/3d 


## dungeon crawl
- Zones based on consoles
- the floors start at 0, going downward to floor 100 (might reverse for sense, as doing negative -2 confusing)
- floor number a bit of a cheat for monster level
- at each floor you need to explorer to find the stairs and that floors boss
- when exploring, you can Encounter a monster, find items, find the stairs, find the boss door or nothing.


## basic 2019 - attempt 3
this was started as a simpler version then playing against another person. To figure out some of the code for
fighting, use items and how monsters battle interactions work.


## Monsters
The monsters cover anything that I could think of and search. The Evolutions are mostly by my choice and then
iterating and having to make a choice. Could I have designed Jumpman evolve into any version of mario, sure, 
did I instead want to have multiple versions when Snes Mario goes into 3d mario, and then another with Baby Mario into a 2d gameboy mario.

Images are all stolen, I can not draw, this game is fan made, with zero donations or ads used. If I have
gotten permission used images, then artiest and link provided.

### Zombified
Traditional pokemon don't die. But I want to play with all the monsters, so death is a risk in this. However
nothing trully dies.
